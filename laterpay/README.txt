Monetize your blog and content with LaterPay. We offer a frictionless transaction experience that helps you increase your revenue streams, conversion rates and online customer interactions.

== Description ==

= Overview =
The LaterPay WordPress plugin is a content monetization solution for your WordPress page. We enable you to collect voluntary financial contributions from your audience, sell individual pieces of content, timed access to your website or individual sections, recurring subscriptions, or ad-free access to your site.

Our unique ‘pay later’ model takes the upfront friction out of the transaction and allows your users to access content instantly by agreeing to pay for it later.

You can offer content priced as low as $0.05 or 0.05€ and audiences can purchase that content with just a click or two - without having to register or provide payment until they reach a $5 or 5€ threshold on their LaterPay tab. At this point we ask them to register and pay and we have found that about 85% of users will do so. Once they become registered LaterPay users, the transactions become even more effortless - in fact, repeat purchases are 2-2.5X higher with the ‘pay later’ model over ‘pay now.’

Although we recommend using the ‘pay later’ model because of the results mentioned above, you are of course free to choose the ‘pay now’ model if it better suits your needs. [Read more about the difference between ‘pay later’ and ‘pay now’.](https://www.laterpay.net/academy/getting-started-with-laterpay-the-difference-between-pay-now-pay-later)
