"                <br>\n"
"                For example, you could sell a \"breaking news\" post for 0.49 (high interest within the first 24 hours)\n"
"                and automatically reduce the price to 0.05 on the second day.\n"

"                You don't have to provide a teaser for every single post on your site:<br>\n"
"                by default, the Laterpay plugin uses the first 60 words of each post as teaser content.\n"
"                <br>\n"
"                Nevertheless, we highly recommend manually creating the teaser for each post, to increase your sales.\n"

"                <strong>Pay Later</strong><br>\n"
"                If you choose to sell your content as <strong>Pay Later</strong>, a user pays the purchased content <strong>later</strong>. The purchase is added to his Laterpay invoice and he has to log in to Laterpay and pay, once his invoice has reached 5.00 (EUR or USD).<br>\n"
"                Laterpay <strong>recommends</strong> Pay Later for all prices up to 5.00 as they deliver the <strong>best purchase experience</strong> for your users.<br>\n"

"                Pay Now are especially suitable for higher-value content and / or content that immediately occasions costs (e. g. license fees for a video stream).<br>\n"

"Meet the online payment system that cares about the user experience as much as you do %1$s %1$s\n"
"                    With Laterpay, your users can purchase digital content and services, or make contributions and donations, with a single click—a frictionless experience that turns traffic into transactions.%1$s %1$s\n"
"                    Requiring upfront registration and payment results in customer abandon rates of up to 98%%. Laterpay's patented Pay Later revenue model instead defers the registration process until a customer’s purchases reach a $5 threshold. Only then, once your content’s value is firmly established, is the customer asked to register and pay. This results in shopping cart conversion rates of over 80%%. Laterpay’s frictionless customer onboarding helps you turn traffic into transactions."
