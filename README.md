## Contributing

This project uses Gulp to build its assets.
Gulp is a node.js module. If you have node.js running, you can install gulp with ```sudo npm install -g gulp```.
Then go to the repository root folder and install the required gulp plugins with ```npm install```.
Now you can run any of the tasks defined in the gulpfile from the repository root folder.
During development you can either watch the repo for changes and automatically recompile the modified assets using ```gulp```.
For exporting the assets for a release, you can also run ```gulp build```.

An [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) file is supplied to make it easier to adjust your IDE to the project standards in applying whitespace.

Contributed PHP code must comply with the WordPress coding standards.
We recommend testing it with PHP_CodeSniffer + [standard 'WordPress'](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards).

All pull requests are automatically linted with JSHint and the [.jshintrc](https://github.com/laterpay/laterpay-wordpress-plugin/blob/master/.jshintrc) included in this repository.
